      Hello! My name is Tristin and I am a computer science student attending
      Clemson University. <br>I enjoy things such as speedrunning, pure math,
      Roblox, TASing and coding. </br>
      <br> I plan on updating this site as I go forward learning CSS and HTML, and later going into JavaScript. </br>
      <br>I would love to intern at Roblox one day.
      <br> I began this site on: 6/27/2024. It is 3:54 PM! EST.
